Here's the revised summary written in the first person:

# D205 - TGM3 TASK 1: DATA ACQUISITION

## Course Summary

At Western Governors University, I developed proficiency in Structured Query Language (SQL) for managing data within healthcare databases. My focus was on identifying emergency service admissions among diabetic patients, using advanced SQL techniques to enhance data accuracy and analysis reliability.

This course included a Practical Assessment.

## Course Objectives

Throughout the course, I developed the following key competencies:
- **Data Examination:** I examined the available data to determine dimensions, quality, relationships, and limitations, specifically focusing on diabetic patient admissions.
- **Model Implementation:** I implemented physical data models to organize and represent healthcare data effectively.
- **SQL Operations:** I performed advanced SQL operations to accurately query and manipulate data within the context of health informatics.

## Course Materials

My study materials comprised a series of courses from DataCamp, focusing on intermediate to advanced SQL techniques and database management relevant to real-world healthcare scenarios.

## Practical Assessment(s) Overview & Files

For the Practical Assessment, I created a robust SQL query setup to analyze emergency service admissions among diabetic patients. This involved importing data, designing database models, and executing complex queries to answer the research question: “How many patients with diabetes are admitted to emergency services?” I used advanced SQL features like common table expressions and case-insensitive matching to ensure precise and reliable results.

My work included a comprehensive SQL script and a video presentation demonstrating the successful execution and explanation of the code and database operations. These can be accessed through links to my GitHub and Google Drive.

## Course Reflection

The project underscored the critical role of accurate data acquisition and SQL in addressing public health questions, particularly in the emergency healthcare context. The skills I gained are directly applicable to enhancing healthcare database management and improving policy and care strategies for diabetic patients in emergency scenarios.
